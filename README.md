A for loop in JavaScript is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code a specific number of times. The syntax for a for loop in JavaScript is as follows: ```javascript for (initialization; condition; increment) { // code to be executed } ``` Here's a simple example of a for loop in JavaScript: ```javascript for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log("Iteration number: " + i); } ``` In this example, the loop will execute the `console.log()` statement 5 times, with the variable `i` taking the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
